      <p>Raquel Bonilla's details</p>
      <p>
        Hello! I am Raquel Bonilla :) I am a web developer and graphic designer.
        I was born in Colombia. Since I was a kid, I’ve always love everything
        related with arts, designing and logical thinking.. Currently I work as
        a freelancer
      </p>

      <p>
        I have always been passionate about art and logic. I started my journey
        as a young artist, learning drawing and animation. I later developed my
        skills in graphic design, learning programs like Animate CC,
        Illustrator, and Photoshop. I also learned English, and developed a high
        level of conversation, listening, and speaking.

      <p>
        My passion for technology led me to study Systems Engineering. I am
        currently in my fifth semester program at the National Open and Distance
        University. In addition to my studies, I completed an Oracle Next
        Education scholarship where I specialized as a Front-End Developer with
        an emphasis on React.js. I have gained a lot of experience through
        freelance work and autonomous learning. I am always eager to learn new
        skills and I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to
        any problem or challenge!
      </p>

      <p>
        In parallel, I developed my skills in web development and design. I
        started with C#, and later focused on the front-end, with CSS, HTML and
        learning programming languages like JavaScript and TypeScript. I also
        worked with web page design using CMS platforms like WordPress, Shopify,
        Blogger, Joomla, Drupal and among others.
